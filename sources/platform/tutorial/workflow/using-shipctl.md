# shipctl reference

This is a command utility that is available in both [runSh](/platform/workflow/job/runsh) and [runCI](/platform/workflow/job/runci) jobs. This is used to perform common operations like getting the path of where state files are stored; getting the config value of the integration used in a Resource and so on.

## Machine images where shipctl is available

shipctl is available in CI and Assembly lines in machine image versions [v5.8.2](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/runtime/machine-image/ami-v582/) and up. If your subscription is using a version lower than v5.8.2, please switch to the latest version of the machine image. To change the machine image for your subscription, please follow the steps documented [here](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/runtime/machine-image/ami-overview/#changing-the-subscription-machine-image).

## State Mgmt

### copy_file_from_prev_state

**Description**

The `copy_file_from_prev_state` utility is used to retrieve a file stored in the state folder by the previous run of the same Job.

## Resource/Job information

The methods in this section apply to both jobs and resources, even though the names might suggest they only work with resources.

### get_resource_env

**Description**

Get an environment value specific to a particular resource or job.  Rather than trying to figure out the sanitized ENV name to use, you can simply utilize this function with your exact resource name to get any special ENV that Shippable adds to your environment for each resource.

**Usage**
```
shipctl get_resource_env <resource name> <env name>
```

- `resource name` is the name of the resource (or job) for which you want the env value.
- `env name` is the piece of the envrionment variable that is typically appended to the resource name.

**Example**

If you have an IN gitRepo resource named myGitRepo, you can access the current commit directly by using `$MYGITREPO_COMMIT`, or you can utilize this new function to avoid having to figure out the name sanitization.

```
shipctl get_resource_env myGitRepo commit
```

### get_resource_id

**Description**

Get the internal unique shippable id for a given resource or job.

## Additional utilities

### decrypt

**Description**

Uses the provided key to decrypt the specified file.  

This is typically used to decrypt information that was encrypted using Shippable keys. It helps you avoid building your own encrypt-decrypt system.

**Usage**

```
shipctl decrypt <source filename> <key filename>
```

- `source filename` is the file to be decrypted
- `key filename` is the fully qualified name of the key file

**Example**

```
MY_DECRYPTED_DATA="$(shipctl decrypt "properties.json" "/key/id_rsa")"
```

### get_json_value

**Description**

Extracts the json property value from the specified file. Field name supports `.` notation and `[n]` for arrays.

This saves you the trouble of parsing a JSON file to read specific property values that are required for your workflow.

**Usage**

```
shipctl get_json_value <filename> <field name>
```

- `filename` is the name of the JSON file
- `field name` is the field for which you want to read the value

**Example**

```
MY_JSON_FIELD="$(shipctl get_json_value "properties.json" "servers[0].ipaddress")"
```

### replace

**Description**

Replaces variables in a file with values based on your current shell `env`. This is useful to create config files from templates, for example.

**Usage**

```
shipctl replace <filename1> <filename2> <filenameN>
```

where your files have placeholders in the format `$ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME` or `${ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME}`.

**Example**

```
shipctl replace properties.json deploy.json run.json
```

###retry

**Description**

Execute any command three times if it returns a non-zero error code. This is useful when you need to execute a command that can be flaky as a result of network hiccups for example.

**Usage**

```
shipctl retry <cmd>
```

- `cmd` is command to be retried

**Example**

```
shipctl retry "docker push manishas/myImage"
```

###sanitize_shippable_string

**Description**

Shippable relies heavily on shell execution. As a result, shell reserved characters like `. , -` and more are not allowed in string names.

The `sanitize_shippable_string` method makes it easy to create a string that will be work with Shippable. It removes all characters that are not`a-z`, `A-Z`, `_`, or `0-9`.

**Usage**

```
shipctl sanitize_shippable_string <string>
```

- `string` is the original string to be sanitized.

**Example**

```
MY_SANITIZED_STRING="$(shipctl sanitize_shippable_string "foo!@#")"
```

This will return `foo`.

### to_uppercase

**Description**

Converts any given string to UPPERCASE.

**Usage**

```
shipctl to_uppercase <string>
```

**Example**

```
MY_UPPERCASE="$(shipctl to_uppercase "foo!@#")"
```

Output of the above statement would be `FOO!@#`
